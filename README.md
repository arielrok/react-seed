## Problem 1 - Bubble Sort

Bubble sort runs in O(nÂ²) time, fastest case is O(n) - linear - when input is already sorted

### If the array has < 2 numbers then return 0, else return the second smallest number.

#### Note: In the above problem you cannot use the method `sort()` so please take a look at bubble sort or any other sort.

### Input
[ [0], [0, 1], [4, 3, 2, 1] ]

### Expected Output
[0, 1, 2]
