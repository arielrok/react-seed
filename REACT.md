### Binding class methods /  `this` in JSX callbacks
https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html

You have to be careful about the meaning of `this` in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind   `this.handleClick` and pass it to `onClick`, `this` will be `undefined` when the function is actually called.

This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without `()` after it, such as `onClick={this.handleClick}`, you should bind that method.

If calling `bind` annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental `public class fields syntax`, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:

```
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

This syntax is enabled by default in `Create React App`.

If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback:

```
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the `LoggingButton` renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.


### ReactDOM / DOM, Life Cycle
https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html

Now the clock ticks every second.

Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:

1. When `<Clock />` is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the constructor of the `Clock` component. Since `Clock` needs to display the current time, it initializes `this.state` with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.
2. React then calls the `Clock` component’s `render()` method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the `Clock`’s render output.
3. When the `Clock` output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. Inside it, the `Clock` component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s `tick()` method once a second.
4. Every second the browser calls the `tick()` method. Inside it, the `Clock` component schedules a UI update by calling `setState()` with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the `render()` method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, `this.state.date` in the `render()` method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.
5. If the `Clock` component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.
